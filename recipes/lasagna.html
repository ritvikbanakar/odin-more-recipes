  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Lasagna is a type of pasta made from very wide, flat sheets. An Italian dish made of lacked layers of lasagna
    with alternating fillings such as rag√π, vegetables, cheeses, and other seasonings/spices. </p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <h4>Cheese Filling</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>15 oz. ricotta cheese, <em>2 cups</em></li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>2 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>3/4 cup Parmesan cheese, <em>freshly grated</em></li>
    <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp pepper</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Meat Sauce</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 yellow onion, <em>finely diced</em></li>
    <li>3/4 lb. ground beef</li>
    <li>3/4 lb. ground Italian sausage</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
    <li>40 oz. marinara sauce</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon hot sauce</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Lasagna</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>12 lasagna noodles, <em>plus extra in case of breakage</em></li>
    <li>2.5 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <h4>Prep Work</h4>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Combine the cheese filling ingredients</strong> in a medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients.</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Make the Meat Sauce</h4>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Heat olive oil</strong> over medium heat and <strong>add the diced onions</strong>. Let them soften for 10 minutes.
    (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes).</li>
    <li><strong>Add the ground beef and sausage</strong> and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat
    so that it's very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. <strong>Add garlic</strong> during the last minute. Drain excess grease.</li>
    <li><strong>Add the chicken broth</strong> and use a silicone spatula to "clean" the bottom and sides of the pot.
    <strong>Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce.</strong> Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.
    Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently.</li>
  </ol>
    <h4>Preheat Oven and Cook the Lasagna Noodles</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to <strong>375&deg.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water</strong> for the lasagna noodles. Once a rapid boil is reached,
      <strong>cook the noodles to al dente</strong> according to package instructions. (Set a timer to ensure you don't overcook them.)
      Gently stir with a wooden spoon throughout cooking to prevent noodles from sticking. <strong>Drain and rinse with cold water</strong>
      until noodles are completely cool.</li>
      <li>Lay the cooled noodles flat on wax or parchment paper while you begin assembling the lasagna.</li>
    </ol>
  <h4>Assemble</h4>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Spread 1 heaping cup of meat sauce</strong> on the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch casserole dish. Next, <strong>add 4
    lasagna noodles,</strong> overlapping them if needed.</li>
    <li><strong>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture</strong>over the noodles, followed by about <strong>1 1/2 cups of meat sauce.</strong></li>
    <li>Top with <strong>4 more lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, 1 1/2 cups meat sauce.</strong></li>
    <li>Finish with <strong>4 more lasagna noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixture,</strong> and <strong>the rest of the meat sauce.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Top with 2 1/2 cups of Mozzarella cheese.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray</strong> and place it spray-side-down on top of the baking dish to prevent the cheese from sticking to it.</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Bake</h4>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Bake for 35 minutes.</strong> <em>Remove cover</em> and <strong>bake for 10 more minutes.</strong></li>
    <li>Remove and garnish with fresh parsley. <strong>Let it sit for 15 minutes prior to serving</strong> to allow the layers to set.
    Serve with garlic bread and cheese.</li>
  </ol>
